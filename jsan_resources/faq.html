Q: I'm having difficult anonymizing my document, do you have any suggestions that could help?
</b></font><br><font size=5>
A: It's generally very difficult to completely separate yourself from a document you have written. To combat this instinct, here's some suggestions:<br><ul>
<li>Pretend it's not your document. You're not proofreading, correcting for grammar, or any of the normal steps one takes when building a document, <i>your only goal is to remove your identity from it.</i></li>
<li>Pretend you're someone else. If you are having trouble anonymizing a sentence, it may be helpful to copy a classic author's style to help distance yourself from your own.</li>
<li>Ask for help! If you have a close friend or family member you can trust, having another mind available to help you come up with new structures or words for your sentences can be very helpful (it's not recommended, however, that one person helps write the entire document, since then you would be simply replcaing your style with theirs.)</li>
</ul></font>

Q: What's the translations tab for? Oftentimes the translations don't even make sense.
</b></font><br><font size=5>
A: While solely using translations to anonymize your document doesn't work very well (it ether changes it too little or too much to the point where the original meaning is lost). We believe, however, that translations can oftentimes give you ideas as to how to reformat your sentences and can help "break the ice" on anonymizing your document. In the case that you find a perfect translation (one that sufficiently changes the sentence while still retaining meaning), you can simply swap the sentence in by clicking the array next to the translation.

Q: What's the suggestions tab for?
</b></font><br><font size=5>
A: The suggestions tab gives you a bird's eye view of the words you use in your documents that expose you the most (elements to remove) as well as words you used that you typically don't and had the best chance of obscuring your identity (elements to add). This serves multiple purposes, as it can help you avoid words that would expose you while formating your document and also give you an idea of what words to replace with synonyms or add more of (if possible).

Q: What are these red highlights in selected sentences?
</b></font><br><font size=5>
A: Anonymouth automatically highlights words to remove by default in a currently highlighted sentence (without having to select them from the list in Suggestions) to help you know what sentences need more work than others. If you would prefer the feature be turned off, you can do so by simply opening Preferences (Anonymouth > Preferneces for OS X and Settings > Preferneces for others) and unchecking "Automatically highlight words to remove in selected sentence".

Q: Why isn't the Ownership Certainty graph changing?
</b></font><br><font size=5>
A: Since the Ownsership Certainty graph relies on results from the processing action, they will not update while editing like the Anonymity Bar above it. In order to get updated Ownsership Certainty results, you must reprocess your document.

Q: Anonymouth is splitting up a sentence that's supposed to be one whole sentence, how do I make it one again?
</b></font><br><font size=5>
A: While we have tried our very best to make the editor as solid as possible, there are bound to be instances we did not anticipate and therefore our editor treats as seperate sentences. In order to fix this, you need only selected the text you wish to be treated as one whole sentence (as if you were wanting to copy and paste it), right click and then select "Combine sentences". Anonymouth will then treat the sentence as one whole sentence for the duration it's open.
